# Rusty Fractals

## Just practicing my rust while enjoying fractals ðŸ˜„

For now, we only have the Mandelbrot Set visualisation

### Controls

| `Mouse Wheel Up`   | Increase iterations evaluated                     |
| `Mouse Wheel Down` | Decrease iterations evaluated                     |
| `Space`            | Step frame-by-frame (will also pause if unpaused) |
| `P`                | Pause/Unpause to render repeatedly (not needed)   |
| `Esc`              | Exit                                              |

The window may also be freely resized, the fractal will adjust to match
